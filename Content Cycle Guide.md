Content cycle guide

Guide to return content to the public.

Content cycle guidlines to develop into a practical guidelines for myself to remember to maintain my stuff and content, and eventually publish as a downloadable book for everyone.

I got so many content, text, images, media files, and lists privately storing on my computer, in email or other online accounts. 
Most could be shared back to the public. 
I will find a way only have really personal things privately and share publicly information.
